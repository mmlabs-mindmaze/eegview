      "message": "Well, strndup() is more like part of the whole \"string\" part of the API, which we did not touch at all in the whole design of the mmlib.\nAdding to that that it would not make sense to add strndup() (as mm_strndup()) without strdup() (as mm_strdup()), but strdup() is present on all platforms ... I\u0027m not all for it.\n\nSince I\u0027m not really using strndup() as a copy of strings: I know the string buffer I am passing to the function is NOT null-terminated.\n\nI propose to rename this memdup() (which it is) and remove teh conditional compilation part altogether.",
